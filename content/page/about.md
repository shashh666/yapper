# Why Yapper?

At first glance, one might think that the name is rather bizarre and that there cannot be a way to spin this positively. However, as I was thinking about a name for this project while commuting to work on a bus, I realized that this name is deeply rooted in how I have come to this point in my life. It is a genuine part of who I am.

When I was growing up, I used to talk a lot with my bench-mates during class and my teachers would yell at me to stop yapping. I didn't stop then. I don't see a reason to stop now.

## A few words about the Yapper.. 

For a few years now, I have been experimenting with writing. I ran a few anonymous blogs with different writing themes but I wasn't able to consistently produce materials that were true to the original motivation of those projects. However, the desire to write and produce content persisted. 
My day job requires me to translate technological advancements into business benefits. And I recently took up the hobby of dabbling with new technologies to occupy my spare time. As I have limited capacity in terms of retaining everything I have touched, I started the practice of documenting my work. That's when I realized that I could build a project to marry my desire to write with my hobby of playing around with technology. _Kill two birds with one stone!_ Thus, the Yapper was born. 

Most of the things on this space would be rants based on my experience in trying to adopt/use/experiment/play around with technology. The problems might not necessarily be big. Most entries might just be of the "_how to_" nature. The primary motivation is of course to document my experiments and experience. I hope that as time goes by and gain more experience, I would be able to add more value to the content and the readers.

## Finally, 
The thoughts and opinions expressed in this blog are my own and do not reflect those of my employer. 

_This project is dedicated to all my friends, mentors, teachers and haters from whom I have learned the importance of continuous learning and the value of yapping._
